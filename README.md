# Molecule Parser

Welcome to the Molecule Parser!
Here You can parse molecules and obtain the exact count for each atom. \
The goal of this repository was for me to learn how to deploy a basic application on AWS Amplify. \ 
It contains the minimal objects required to do so and would probably be of some interest for a developer with with the same objective. \

# Deployment

The app can be deployed on AWS Amplify, using lambda.py as the lambda function (REST API).
This API is called in App.jss .

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`
To use the application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
